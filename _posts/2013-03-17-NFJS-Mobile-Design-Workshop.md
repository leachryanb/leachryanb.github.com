# Mobile Design Workshop

## Mobile is exploding

* Sure, for most things you can rely soley on a browser app, but some features will require you to use an app:
  * camera

* Space, especially horizontal space, is at a premium.  (Infinite scroll)
* flicking is a very natural gesture
* fingers aren't precise - give it room to breath

* Fitt's law - Distance and size

* Menus are tough to hit

* Fastest targets
  * Four corners
  * Right click
  * 44 x 44 = smallest target.  Generally points.
    * This is really small.  Too small.
    * In theory, you an shrink to 44 x 30, but leave white space

* Design for one handed use.  Think of reach.
* Gestures aren't discoverable - For shortcuts only

## Discoverability

* No manuals!
  * When was the last time you were given a manual for software
  * People are programmed to skip through intros and wizards and startup help
  * If you do need to drive someone through help, use a handwriting font to differentiate from app

* Dark Sky - Great app for telling you if it's going to rain in the next hour

## Prototyping
  * Paper Prototyping is great
    * no investment
    * no procurement
  * you can use paper prototypes for user testing
  * App - POP - Prototyping on Paper - http://popapp.in
  * Iterate rapidly
  * Balsamic, Mockingbird, iMockups, Blueprint, etc
  * Sloppy is good
  * Don't let the demo look done
    * Perfection is distracting
    * People get hung up on the wrong things
    * The more done - the more focused the feedback
    * The less done - the more broad spectrum the feedback
