This weekend I went to the NFJS conf North of Boston.  Very Java heavy, but there were 2 talks I appreciated in particular:

[Nathaniel Shutta](https://twitter.com/ntschutta) Gave a really great talk on the state of mobile in his [Mobile Design Workshop](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/boston/2013/03/session?id=28055) that scared the livin' bejeezus outta me.  Made some great points about how important mobile 1<sup>st</sup> is.  I hadn't been following the stats of late, but the numbers on smartphone activations and sales vs PCs are alarming.  Nice connection on how focusing on mobile helps you hone your message in general.

Also heard a great talk from [Brian Sletten](http://twitter.com/bsletten) on [Modeling Resources: REST and Hypermedia](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/boston/2013/03/session?id=28044).  Helpful focus on the fact that the web and specifically REST is about exposing resources not just creating "services".  The identity of resources is what's important, not how it gets there.  Great explanation of the original spec intent of all the verbs, which are itempotent, etc, and how we overuse POST.

Good stuff.
